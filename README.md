# CSCN 8010 LAB 3 - Vanilla CNN and Fine-Tune VGG16 - for Dogs and Cats Classification

### Introduction:

In this lab, we will work through a common practice of Deep Learning Engineers - that is - take an existing model, that does something similar to what the engineer is interested doing, and fine-tune it for the specific task at-hand.

The dataset is taken from Kaggle:<b> <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/biaiscience/dogs-vs-cats"> Dogs vs Cats Dataset </a> </b>
